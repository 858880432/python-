 **Python** has a great library [*sympy*](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) which allows us to do many calculations,
 and display them in a manner we are used to.
 

### Before you import sympy you need to install it:

  ```python 
 pip3 install sympy
 ```
 

### You can also do the same through the requirements.txt file

```python
pip install requirements.txt
```

Some examples have been included for easier use.
