# Email Alert Automation Script

The Email Alert Automation Script is a Python script designed to automate the process of sending email notifications based on predefined conditions or triggers.

## Functionalities
- Sends email notifications based on critical events such as errors or updates.
- Customizable email templates, allowing users to modify subject lines and body content.
- Supports multiple recipients for notifications.
- Includes error handling to manage failed email deliveries.
- Provides logging for successful email sends and errors.

## Setup Instructions
To set up and run the Email Alert Automation Script on your system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content (if you need additional dependencies):
   ```
   # requirements.txt
   logging
   ```

3. **Install required packages**:
   If you have other dependencies (in this case, none are needed beyond the standard library), install them:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Modify Configuration**:
   Update the following variables in the `email_alert.py` script:
   ```python
   SMTP_SERVER = 'smtp.example.com'  # Replace with your SMTP server
   SMTP_PORT = 587                    # SMTP port (e.g., 587 for TLS)
   USERNAME = 'your_email@example.com'  # Your email address
   PASSWORD = 'your_email_password'     # Your email password
   ```

5. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python email_alert.py
   ```

## Detailed Explanation of Script
The script leverages the `smtplib` and `email.mime.text` libraries to send email notifications. It defines a `send_email` function that constructs an email message and connects to the SMTP server to send it. 

- **Functionality**: The script can be easily customized to fit different use cases by modifying the subject, body, and recipient lists.
- **Error Handling**: It includes basic error handling to log any issues that arise during email sending.

```python
def send_email(subject, body, recipients):
    try:
        ...
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f'Failed to send email: {e}')
```

## Output
The script sends email notifications to the specified recipients. Below is a sample output:

![Sample Email Notification](link_to_your_image.png)

*Replace `link_to_your_image.png` with the actual image URL showing the email notification.*
