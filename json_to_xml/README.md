# JSON to XML Converter

A standalone Python script that converts a JSON file into an XML file. This script is useful for transforming JSON data into a structured XML format for use in systems that require XML-based input.

## Features

- Reads JSON data from a file.
- Converts nested JSON objects and arrays into XML elements.
- Outputs well-structured XML files with proper formatting and indentation.
- Adds a standard XML declaration header (`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`).

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or later installed on your system.

### Installation
1. Clone or download this script to your local system.
2. Save the JSON data you want to convert in a file named `input.json` in the same directory as the script.

### Running the Script
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using the following command:
